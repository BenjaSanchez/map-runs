* new features:
  * keep run highlighted when clicked on (not possible afaik with folium atm)
  * display basic stats of the run when clicked on
* performance issues:
  * switch to better rendering (folium is slow)
  * skip build if no data is added
* misc:
  * add tests
  * build as python package (setup.py, __init__.py, etc)
  * add `.ini` file for `lat`/`lon` variables
